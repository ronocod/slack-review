## Installation
* Set up an [incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) on your Slack account and grab the Webhook URL
* If using this through the repo, load this into `chrome://extensions/` using *"Load Unpacked Extension"*
* Enter in your webhook URL and other details through the extension options page in Chrome

## A note on security
This extension stores your incoming webhook URL locally, so it's only as secure as your Chrome install.
